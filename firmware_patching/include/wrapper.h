 * This file contains function prototypes for functions that already exist *
 * in the original firmware of the BCM4339 Wifi chip. With this file, we   *
 * intend to build wrapper functions that can be called directly from C    *
 * after including this header file and linking against the resulting      *
 * object file ../wrapper/wrapper.o. The latter is generated using the     *
 * Makefile ../wrapper/Makefile. Besides the object file, it also creates  *
 * the linker file ../wrapper/wrapper.ld which is based on this header     *
 * file. To make this work, the function prototypes have to be written as  *
 * one line per prototype. Each prototype has to start with the word       *
 * "extern" and end with a comment containing the functions location in    *
 * memory as a hex number. Before the address, there has to be a space.    *                                                       *
